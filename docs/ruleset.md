Version 1.0

# 1. PURPOSE OF THE GAME

- In easy mode it will be necessary to defeat the four kings and conquer the four holy relics.
- In difficult mode you will need to defeat ALL the enemies in the deck and not just the 4 kings.

## 1.1. GAME COMPONENTS

- Minimum
  - A deck of Italian Cards.
  - One six sided die.
- Recommended
  - A Ruba Dungeon deck of playing cards.
  - Five six sided dice

# 2. DECKS COMPOSITION

- Choose a random card from those of value 8 or 9. This Card will be the Hero.
- Create the Character Deck with all remaining cards of value 8, 9 or 10.
- Create the Relic Deck with the four Aces.
- Create the Dungeon Deck with all remaining Cards.

The Hero starts with 12 HP, we suggest using 2D6 placed on the Hero Card (7) to represent his HP.

In easy mode enemies always enter Combat with 6HP, we suggest using 1D6 for the Enemy of the turn.

In difficult mode enemies will have as much HP as the value of the respective card (Jacks = 8HP,
Knights = 9HP, Kings = 10HP).

_Both Hero and enemies cannot, even by healing themselves, have more hit points than their initial
maximum._

# 3. CRAWLING

Draw a card from the Dungeon Deck (1) and place it uncovered on the Event Cards Deck (2).

If the Dungeon Deck runs out you take all the Event Cards (2), shuffle them and create a newDungeon
Deck (1).

## 3.1 EVENT CARD RESOLUTION

Event Cards are resolved automatically either by throwing 1D6 or by
playing 1 or more Gold Cards to resolve them favorably.

## 3.2. RESOLUTION THROUGH DIE TEST 1D6

Whenever a test is to be made, 1D6 is rolled.

- 1 always corresponds to a failure
- 6 always corresponds to a success
- From 2 to 5 the roll is successful if the value is equal to or greater than the Event Card Value.

> Examples:
> - A test on 7 succeeds only with 6
> - A test on 5 succeeds with 5 or with 6
> - A test on 3 succeeds with 3, 4, 5 or 6

## 3.3. RESOLUTION THROUGH GOLD CARDS

By using one or more Gold Cards and spending a total sum equal to or greater than the value of the
Event Card, the Resolution is automatically successful. Gold Cards played are placed on top of the
Event Card. All numbers with a comma should be rounded down. In the case of encountering a Swords
(combat) card you will have two options:

- Spending an amount of gold equal to the value of the Event Card continues the Crawling phase
without engaging in combat.
- In easy mode, by spending an amount of gold greater than the value of the Event Card you reveal
the Enemy Card: if the Enemy is a King the Combat begins, otherwise the Combat automatically ends
in your favor, the Enemy Card becomes a Help Card and you continue Crawling. In difficult mode you
will have to spend twice the value of the Event Card to achieve this result.

| SUIT    | EVENT      | AUTO                  | FAILURE           | SUCCESS       |
|---------|------------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Clubs   | Trap       | -                     | HP = HP - (VCE/2) | -             |
| Cups    | Concoction | -                     | HP = HP - (VCE/2) | HP = HP + VCE |
| Deniers | Gold       | Add to Gold Cards (8) | -                 | -             |
| Swords  | Combat     | Starts a fight        | -                 | -             |

> - HP = Character Hit Points
> - VCE = Event Card Value

# 4. COMBAT

Draw a card from the Character Deck (3) and place it in the space in front of the Hero. (5)

## 4.1. REVELATION OF THE ENEMY

The card you have just drawn represents the opponent you are about to fight. It may be a King, a
Knight or a Knave. Each class of enemy has its own specificities.

| ENEMY  | HP (easy) | HP (hard) | POWER (hard) |
|--------|----------:|----------:|--------------|
| KING   | 6         | 10        | Relic (*)    |
| KNIGHT | 6         |  9        |              |
| JACK   | 6         |  8        |              |

> - (*) = The King fights with his own Relic, so he enjoys a +1 passive perpetual bonus to cards of
> his own suit (In Easy Mode the King will not have the Relic bonus during combat).

## 4.2. COMBAT TURN

A Combat Turn consists of three Actions.

1. Serve face-up cards from the Dungeon Deck and place them in a row to the right of the Hero until
you have 3 Hero Action Cards. Serve 3 covered cards from the Dungeon Deck and place them in a row
to the right of the Enemy.
2. Each Action unveil one of the three Enemy Action Cards starting with the one furthest to the
right.
3. Choose one of the Hero Action Cards to respond to the Enemy Action Card. In the case of playing
Combos it will also be possible to play more than one card in a round. See below for details.

- If after an Action the Hero has 0 or less HP it is Game Over.
- If, after an Action, the Enemy has 0 or less HP, we move to the End of Combat phase.
- If after three Actions no one has 0 or less HP a new Turn is started.
- If the Dungeon Deck runs out you take all the Event Cards (2), shuffle them and create a new
Dungeon Deck (1).

## 4.3. COMBAT RESOLUTION

Both consequences of Action Cards are applied simultaneously. The Hero chooses one of his Action
Cards to respond to the Enemy's Action Card.

The Hero must add +1 to the value of the card, for each Relic in his possession having the same
suit as the card just played. The Hero may add +1 to the card value, for each Help Card of the same
suit in his possession.

If used, the Help Cards should be discarded and placed on the Catacomb (4) if we are playing in
Easy mode. Otherwise, the Help Cards will go to the enemy, before ending up in the Catacomb.

All resolved Action Cards should be placed on Event Cards (2).

> Examples:
> 1. The Enemy plays a 4 of Swords to which the Hero responds with a 7 of Cups. In addition, the
> Hero also possesses a Cups relic(+1 to the value of the Cups cards).
> The exchange then ends with 4 HP recovered by the Hero.
> 2. The Enemy plays a 3 of Deniers (shields) to which the Hero responds with a 6 of Swords and two
> Swords Help Cards. The clash ends with the Enemy losing 5 Hp.
> 3. The Enemy plays a 4 of Cups to which the Hero responds with a 3 of Cups. The clash ends with
> the Enemy recovering 4 Hp and the Hero recovering 3 Hp.

## 4.4. COMBO

Action Cards with the same value can be used together to respond to an Enemy's Action, the Value of
the Action Cards add up, the Seed is chosen by the player from the seeds of the Action Cards used
in the Combo.

> Example:
>
> The Hero has a 5 of Swords, a 5 of Deniers and a 5 of Cups. In this case he can play a Combo of
> two or three Action Cards. The choice falls on a Combo consisting of the 5 of Swords and the 5 of
> Coins for a total Value of 10 and with Seed chosen Swords thus inflicting 10 Points of Damage on
> the Enemy.

The remaining Actions take place as usual, if the player has no Action Cards to respond he suffers
the full effects of the opponent's Action Cards.

> Example:
>
> If the Hero responds with a Combo consisting of two Action Cards to the first Action, he must
> then respond with his last Action Card to the second Action and suffer without responding to the
> third Action.

| SUIT    | EVENT                | EFFECT                                             |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Clubs   | Parry and Attack (*) | Defends against damage from other Clubs = VCE (**) |
| Cups    | Healing Potion       | Heals HP = VCE                                     |
| Deniers | Shield               | Shields from damage = VCE                          |
| Swords  | Attack               | Inflicts damage = VCE                              |

> - HP = Character Hit Points
> - VCE = Event Card Value
> - (*) = Can parry only damage from attacks made with other Clubs.
> - (**) = If points are left over after absorbing incoming damage, those excess points are
> inflicted as damage to the opponent.

## 4.5. RELICS

Each opposing king holds one of four relics, each related to its suit.

Possession of a relic grants a passive and perpetual +1 bonus to any card, of the same suit, played
in combat.

## 4.6. HELP CARDS

Every time we defeat an enemy in combat, he will turn into a Help Card, which we will be able to
keep (9) and use in combat. Help Cards function like a relic: when used in conjunction with a
combat card of the same suit, they give it a +1 bonus.

In easy mode, used Help Cards are eliminated from the game.

In difficult mode, however, the used Help Cards will become available to our enemies and will be
used by the first enemy to play a card of that suit, after which they will be eliminated from the
game.

## 4.7. END OF COMBAT

Hero Action Cards left over after a fight can (if the player so wishes) be kept in place until the
next fight. You can also keep only some action cards and discard the others you don't want to keep.

If the Enemy is a King, when he dies he will also leave behind the Relic Card (10) corresponding to
the Enemy's suit. The card thus obtained is placed together with the other Obtained Relics (6).

## 4.8. GAME END

In easy mode, the game ends when all 4 relics are captured.

In hard mode, the game ends the instant you defeat ALL enemies, including the 4 kings.
